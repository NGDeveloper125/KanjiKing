# KanjiKing

KanjiKing is a Japanese language learning app focused on memorizing Hiragana, Katakana, and (in future updates) Kanji through engaging memory games. This project is being developed as a learning journey into JavaScript, React Native, and frontend development.

## Project Overview

This is an open-source project aimed at helping users learn Japanese characters through interactive gameplay. Feel free to fork and modify the project for your own use or contribute to its development.

### Current Features (Hiragana & Katakana Game)

The first phase of the app focuses on learning Hiragana and Katakana through a memory matching game:
- Users are presented with Japanese characters (Hiragana/Katakana)
- Multiple English translations appear as choices
- Players must select the correct translation to score points
- All character sets are included in the core game files
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Score tracking system

### Future Plans (Kanji Extension)

The next major update will introduce Kanji learning features:
- New memory game format focused on Kanji characters
- Input-based gameplay where users write translations
- Core set of 100 common Kanji words
- API integration for expanding word sets
- Custom word group creation
- Progress tracking system
